    <ul>
        <li>I was the first person at Louis Vuitton Collins street to sell our latest watch<br /> 
            collections that launched this year called the Tambour watch. The tambour watch pieces<br /> 
            were designed by Jean Arnault, Marketing and Development Director for Louis Vuitton Watches.<br />
            His watches are said to be potentially the global reset of how we look at luxury watches. I was able<br /> 
            to sell two of the most lucrative watches to very high valuable clients:<br />
